   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to sedstacker's documentation!
======================================

sedstacker is a Python toolkit for statistically combining spectral energy 
distributions (SEDs) using built-in or custom algorithms. Users can input
SED data from ASCII files, edit the data, normalize and redshift the SEDs, and 
then combine or "stack" the fluxes along the spectral axis in user-defined 
bin sizes. The stacked SEDs can be saved to an ASCII file for later analysis, 
and may be re-read using sedstacker.
